# Invitable

This is a placeholder repository for an upcoming Rails engine that allows you to integrate a simple invite system in your rails app.
The system is currently being developed and battle tested in [games.directory](https://games.directory) and [games.directory(repo)](https://github.com/games-directory/games.directory).

Our main goal is to achieve a very simple, invite system, for your Rails app where you can easily create and track your invites.
